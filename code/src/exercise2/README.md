### Unable to check sub-exercises
We didn't complete all sub-exercises from exercises 1, 2 and 3, but our OLAT course doesn't provide an option to tick sub-exercises. In our assessment we would give us 1.5 points for exercise 1, 3 points for exercise 2 and also 3 points for exercise 4, totalling to 7.5/10 points for the whole exercise sheet.
