### Point distribution
- Exercise 1 (3 / 3 points):
  - [x] a) (0.5 / 0.5 points)
  - [x] b) (0.5 / 0.5 points)
  - [x] c) (2.0 / 2.0 points)
  
- Exercise 2 (3 / 7 points): 
  - [x] (3 / 7 points)
 
- Total 6 / 10 points

### Note
Exercise 2 is not divided into sub-exercises and there is therefore no way to give yourself f.e. only half of the points. We only give us 3 points for the second exercise because we encountered some problems that we didn't manage to resolve.
