### Exercise 2 (0 / 3 points)
Based on your analyses of last week, we now aim to develop a recommender system that is able to deal with (and model) sequential data as utilized in the RecSys challenge scenario. To get a first overview on how such sequence- or session-awareness could be implemented in a recommender system, please read the following paper by Massimo Quadrana et al.: Massimo Quadrana, Paolo Cremonesi, and Dietmar Jannach.  Sequence-aware recommender systems.ACM Computing Surveys (CSUR), 51(4):66, 2018. URL https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08452.pdfPlease answer the following questions based on the paper:
  
- a (0.5 Points): How do the authors characterize the problem tackled by sequence-aware recommender systems?

- b (0.5 Points): Give a short overview of the different tasks that can be addressed by sequence-aware recommender systems.

- c (2 Points): How do the algorithms presented solve the task of computing sequence-aware recommendations? Please shortly characterize the approaches taken.
